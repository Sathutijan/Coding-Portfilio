# Description:  The program asks the user for number of adults and kids(under 16)
#               attending the play for a night. If the value entered ia negative
#               the program will display an error message. If not Using the input,
#               the program will calculate the revenue based on the number of tickets sold.
#               Then, the program will determine if the revenue created is a loss or profit
#               by subtracting the revenue by the expenses of play for a day ($5000)
#               and displays the result and itâ€™s amount on screen to the user. If user desires a
#               second night the program will repeat but the expenses will be 2500$.
#               Finally, the program will add the profit/loss of both nights and display
#               it on screen to the user.
